# DCGAN Image Generator API

This project implements a RESTful API using FastAPI to generate images using a pre-trained Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) model.

## Overview

The DCGAN Image Generator API allows you to generate realistic images using a trained DCGAN model. It provides a user-friendly interface to request and retrieve generated images.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6+
- PyTorch
- FastAPI
- Uvicorn

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone



# API Endpoints
